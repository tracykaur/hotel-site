<h1>Hotel T</h1>
<br/>
<p>The distinctive sail-shaped silhouette of Hotel T is more than just a stunning hotel, it is a symbol of modern Dubai.

Yet for all the wonder this stunning structure provides when you finally see it in person, it is the service within that really makes the Hotel T so extraordinary.

Repeatedly voted the world's most luxurious hotel, this magnificent destination offers you the finest service and experiences throughout - right down to an optional chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce, helicopter trips from an iconic helipad, private beach access, luxury leisure on a breathtaking terrace with pools and cabanas as well as some of the worldâ€™s best dining venues, including the highly acclaimed Nathan Outlaw at Al Mahara.

Hotel T suite-only accommodation offers discreet check-in within your suite, a private reception on every floor and a host of personal butlers, each a warm messenger of our unparalleled hospitality.

Come and experience it for yourself. <br>
